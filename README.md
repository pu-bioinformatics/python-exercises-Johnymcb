# python-exercises

For each of the exercises in in the Jupyter Notebooks, you are required to create a Python Script, approriately named and stored in the right directory. Take note that you will be graded on:
- how you organize your directories
- How well you document your code and repo
- How you use Git and GitHub (informative commit message, etc)
- And the correctness of your scripts


Work through all the exercises to notebook 6
